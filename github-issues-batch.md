## Issue #1: [CRITICAL] Rate Limiting Not Functioning - DDoS Vulnerability

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** security, bug, critical

### Description
Red team assessment discovered that rate limiting middleware is not properly blocking requests. Testing revealed 150 consecutive requests were processed without any 429 responses, indicating a complete bypass of rate limiting protection.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the development server
2. Send 150 rapid requests to `/api/health` endpoint
3. Observe that all requests return 200 status codes
4. No 429 (Too Many Requests) responses are returned

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected:** After 100 requests within 15 minutes, subsequent requests should return 429 status
**Actual:** All 150 requests processed successfully with 200 status codes

### Impact
- Server vulnerable to DDoS attacks
- No protection against brute force attempts
- Resource exhaustion possible
- Could lead to service downtime

### Root Cause Analysis
The rate limiting middleware in `/api/middleware/rateLimiting.ts` appears to be implemented but not actively blocking requests. Possible issues:
- Middleware not properly applied to all routes
- Key generation not working correctly
- In-memory store not persisting between requests
- Configuration issues in `/api/server.ts`

### Proposed Solution
1. Debug rate limiting middleware application order
2. Verify key generation logic for IP/user identification
3. Consider implementing Redis-backed store for production
4. Add comprehensive rate limiting tests
5. Implement monitoring and alerting for rate limit violations

### Files to Modify
- `/api/middleware/rateLimiting.ts` - Fix middleware logic
- `/api/server.ts` - Verify middleware application order
- Add integration tests for rate limiting
- Add monitoring dashboard

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks requests after configured threshold
- [ ] Different endpoints have appropriate rate limits
- [ ] Rate limiting works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- [ ] Proper 429 responses with Retry-After headers
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all rate limiting scenarios

## Issue #2: [CRITICAL] Missing Security Headers Expose XSS Vulnerabilities

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** security, xss, headers

### Description
Security audit revealed critical missing security headers that expose the application to XSS attacks and other client-side vulnerabilities. Headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Content-Security-Policy are not being set properly.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Make a request to any API endpoint
2. Inspect response headers
3. Notice absence of security headers

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected:** All responses should include comprehensive security headers
**Actual:** Security headers missing or incorrectly configured

### Impact
- XSS attack vulnerability
- Clickjacking attacks possible
- MIME type sniffing attacks
- Content injection vulnerabilities

### Missing Headers Identified
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Content-Security-Policy` (too permissive)
- `Referrer-Policy`

### Root Cause Analysis
While security headers middleware exists in `/api/middleware/securityHeaders.ts`, it may not be properly applied or there are configuration issues preventing headers from being set correctly.

### Proposed Solution
1. Verify helmet middleware is properly configured
2. Ensure security headers middleware is applied in correct order
3. Test CSP policy for proper restrictions
4. Add header validation tests
5. Configure production-specific security policies

### Files to Modify
- `/api/middleware/securityHeaders.ts` - Fix header application
- `/api/server.ts` - Verify middleware order
- Add security header tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All security headers present in responses
- [ ] CSP policy blocks unauthorized scripts
- [ ] X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking
- [ ] MIME sniffing protection active
- [ ] Tests verify all headers are set correctly

## Issue #3: [CRITICAL] API Endpoints Return Improper Status Codes

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Priority:** P0
**Labels:** security, api, error-handling

### Description
All API endpoints consistently return 200 status codes regardless of request validity or authentication status. This improper status code handling masks errors and could expose sensitive information about the application's internal state.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Send invalid requests to API endpoints
2. Send unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints
3. Send malformed JSON payloads
4. All requests return 200 status codes

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected:**
- 401 for unauthenticated requests
- 400 for invalid requests
- 403 for forbidden access
- 404 for not found resources
- 422 for validation errors

**Actual:** All requests return 200 status codes

### Impact
- Information disclosure vulnerability
- Difficult to implement proper error handling
- Security through obscurity issues
- Client-side error handling breaks
- Monitoring and logging ineffective

### Root Cause Analysis
API route handlers are not implementing proper HTTP status code responses. This could be due to:
- Missing error handling middleware
- Improper exception handling in route handlers
- Default success response regardless of operation outcome

### Proposed Solution
1. Implement comprehensive error handling middleware
2. Create standardized error response format
3. Add proper status codes for all scenarios
4. Implement request validation with appropriate error responses
5. Add API documentation with proper status codes

### Files to Modify
- `/api/routes/*` - Add proper status code handling
- `/api/server.ts` - Improve error handling middleware
- Add comprehensive API error handling tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Authentication failures return 401
- [ ] Invalid requests return 400
- [ ] Forbidden access returns 403
- [ ] Not found resources return 404
- [ ] Validation errors return 422
- [ ] All status codes properly documented

## Issue #4: [HIGH] CORS Headers Not Configured - Cross-Origin Attack Risk

**Severity:** ðŸŸ  High
**Priority:** P1
**Labels:** security, cors, headers

### Description
CORS headers are not properly configured, potentially allowing unauthorized cross-origin requests. This could enable CSRF attacks and unauthorized access to API endpoints from malicious websites.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Make cross-origin request from external domain
2. Check for CORS headers in response
3. Verify Access-Control-Allow-Origin restrictions

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected:** Strict CORS policy allowing only trusted origins
**Actual:** CORS headers missing or too permissive

### Impact
- CSRF attack vulnerability
- Unauthorized cross-origin data access
- API abuse from malicious websites
- Sensitive data exposure

### Root Cause Analysis
While CORS configuration exists in `/api/middleware/securityHeaders.ts`, it may not be properly applied or configured for production environments.

### Proposed Solution
1. Verify CORS middleware application
2. Configure strict origin allowlist
3. Implement proper preflight handling
4. Add CORS configuration tests
5. Different CORS policies for different environments

### Files to Modify
- `/api/middleware/securityHeaders.ts` - Fix CORS configuration
- `/api/server.ts` - Verify CORS middleware application
- Add CORS integration tests

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CORS headers present in all responses
- [ ] Only trusted origins allowed in production
- [ ] Preflight requests handled correctly
- [ ] Credentials properly controlled
- [ ] Tests verify CORS functionality
