# The Citibank “Trading Game” – Rules & Dynamics of Gary Stevenson’s Recruitment Challenge

## 1. Game Setup & Card Distribution  

- **Deck**: 17 cards — the numbers **1 – 15**, plus **20** and **-10**.  
- **Players**: Exactly **five** sit at the table in each round.  
- **Deal**:  
  1. Every player receives **one private card**.  
  2. **Three cards** are placed **face-down** in the centre (“the middle”).  
- **Objective**: Bet on the **total sum of all eight cards** (5 private + 3 central).  
- **Information asymmetry**:  
  - Your private card hints at whether the final total will be high or low.  
  - High card (e.g., 15 or 20) ⇒ likely high total; low card (e.g., -10) ⇒ likely low total.  
- **Average maths**: Before any cards are seen the expected total is about **61.2** (8 × 7.65).  
- **Reveals**: The three middle cards are turned face-up **in stages** during the round, shifting expectations as play unfolds.

## 2. Trading Mechanics  

- **Free-for-all floor**: No turns; anyone can speak to anyone at any time.  
- **Quote request**: Ask another player *“What’s your price?”*  
- **Two-way market rule**: The responder must give a **bid–ask quote** with a **fixed 2-point spread** (e.g., “65–67”).  
- **Trade execution**: The asker can immediately  
  - **Buy** at the ask (betting the total will finish **above** the ask), or  
  - **Sell** at the bid (betting the total will finish **below** the bid).  
- **Settlement**: After the last card is revealed, each trade pays ± 1 point per point difference between the trade price and the final total.  
  - Example: You **buy at 62** → final total 70 → **+8** to you, **-8** to the seller.  
- **Arbitrage**: If players quote wildly different prices, a quick trader can buy low from one and sell high to another, locking in risk-free profit.  
- **Bluffing allowed**: Quotes may or may not reflect a player’s true card — reading people is part of the game.

## 3. Bluffing, Personality & Psychological Strategy  

- **Math ≠ victory**: Everyone can calculate expected values; **winning requires out-trading people**.  
- **Information leakage**: A naïve “67–69” quote screams *“I hold a huge card”*.  
- **Stevenson’s approach**:  
  1. **Open with a loud bluff** to mislead opponents about his card.  
  2. **Read faces, voices, confidence** — decide who’s smart, who’s timid.  
  3. **Manipulate prices**: If he wants to buy, quote aggressively low; if he wants to sell, push prices high.  
- **Social engineering**: Many players, unsure of themselves, follow whoever looks confident.  
- **Lesson**: Markets are about **people, perception, and pressure**, not just probabilities.

## 4. Hidden Central Cards & Scoring  

- **Staged reveals**: Each middle card flips up partway through the two-minute round, jolting valuations.  
- **Zero-sum payoff**: Every bilateral trade nets to zero across the table.  
- **Final tally**: Sum all trade P/L to get each player’s score.  
- **Citibank twist**: In Stevenson’s national final the organisers **rigged the three middle cards** (all extremely high) to test how he’d react when everything moved against him.  
- **Key trait tested**: Would a trader **keep backing themselves** under extreme adversity?

## 5. Real-World Trading Floor Parallels  

| Game Element | Real Market Parallel |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Two-way quotes with fixed spread | Market-maker bid/ask quotes |
| Shouting prices, no turn order | Open-outcry / fast voice trading |
| Hidden middle cards revealed later | New information hitting the market |
| Arbitrage of mis-aligned quotes | Cross-market arbitrage opportunities |
| Bluffing & reading opponents | Trade psychology & information games |
| Rigged final to test nerve | Stress tests / “how do you behave in a crisis?” |

## 6. Key Takeaways for a Digital Adaptation  

1. **Open voice (or chat) floor** — simultaneous offers, not turn-based.  
2. **Mandatory two-way quotes** with a small fixed spread.  
3. **Hidden central cards** that reveal gradually to create information shocks.  
4. **Emphasis on bluffing & personality**: avatars, emotes, or voice chat should let players project confidence or deception.  
5. **Fast scoring engine**: settle every trade automatically at round end.  
6. **Optional AI bots** with archetypal personalities (aggressive, poker-faced, quant, skeptic, buddy-buddy).  
7. **Smart-contract ready**: each trade could be an on-chain bet; pot distribution handled trustlessly.  
8. **House cut**: percentage of total trading volume, configurable per room.
