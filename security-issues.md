# Security Issues to Create for A-Trading-Game-WTF

## GitHub CLI Commands to Create Security Issues

**Note:** These commands require proper GitHub authentication with repo permissions. Run `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s repo` first if needed.

### 1. API Key Exposed (COMPLETED)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🚨 CRITICAL: API Key Exposed in Git History" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
API key was exposed in git history in .env file, creating a critical security vulnerability.

### Resolution
- ✅ Key removed from .env file
- ✅ Added .env to .gitignore
- ✅ Confirmed no API key in current codebase

### Action Required
- [ ] Get new API key from ElevenLabs
- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Revoke the old exposed key

### Priority: CRITICAL
### Labels: security, critical, api-keys
EOF
)"
```

### 2. Input Validation (COMPLETED)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🚨 CRITICAL: No Input Validation - XSS/Injection Risk" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
No input validation or sanitization anywhere in the application, creating XSS and injection vulnerabilities.

### Resolution
- ✅ Created comprehensive security.ts with DOMPurify and Joi validation
- ✅ Implemented sanitizeInput() and validateInput() functions
- ✅ Added security utilities for safe HTML rendering
- ✅ File: /apps/web/src/lib/security.ts

### Action Required
- [ ] Apply validation to all user input endpoints
- [ ] Implement security middleware in API routes
- [ ] Add client-side validation to forms

### Priority: CRITICAL
### Labels: security, critical, xss, injection
EOF
)"
```

### 3. Firebase Rules (COMPLETED)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🚨 CRITICAL: Firebase Database Completely Open" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
Firebase database has no security rules - completely open to read/write for anyone.

### Resolution
- ✅ Created comprehensive firebase.rules with proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ Rules restrict access to authenticated users and resource owners only
- ✅ Added data validation rules

### Action Required
- [ ] Deploy rules to Firebase production environment
- [ ] Test rules in Firebase emulator
- [ ] Monitor security rules dashboard

### Priority: CRITICAL
### Labels: security, critical, firebase, database
EOF
)"
```

### 4. Bot Sandbox (COMPLETED)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🚨 CRITICAL: Bot System Allows Arbitrary Code Execution" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
Bot system executes user code directly without sandboxing, allowing arbitrary code execution.

### Resolution
- ✅ Implemented SecureBotSandbox with Worker Threads isolation
- ✅ Created bot-worker.js with restricted environment
- ✅ Added timeout limits and memory restrictions
- ✅ Files: /packages/bot/src/sandbox/SecureBotSandbox.ts, bot-worker.js

### Action Required
- [ ] Deploy sandbox to production environment
- [ ] Test with malicious code samples
- [ ] Monitor bot execution logs

### Priority: CRITICAL
### Labels: security, critical, sandbox, code-execution
EOF
)"
```

### 5. Rate Limiting (PENDING)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🔥 HIGH: No Rate Limiting - DDoS Vulnerability" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ⚠️ PENDING

### Problem
No rate limiting on API endpoints, vulnerable to DDoS attacks and abuse.

### Progress
- ✅ express-rate-limit package installed
- ⚠️ Rate limiting middleware needs implementation

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware in API routes
- [ ] Configure different limits for different endpoints
- [ ] Add Redis store for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] Test rate limiting with load testing

### Priority: HIGH
### Labels: security, high, rate-limiting, ddos
EOF
)"
```

### 6. CORS Config (PENDING)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🔥 HIGH: CORS Configuration Too Permissive" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ⚠️ PENDING

### Problem
CORS configuration is too permissive, allowing cross-origin attacks.

### Progress
- ✅ CORS configuration created in security.ts
- ⚠️ CORS middleware needs deployment to Express app

### Next Steps
- [ ] Apply CORS middleware to Express application
- [ ] Configure environment-specific CORS origins
- [ ] Test CORS policy with different origins
- [ ] Add preflight request handling

### Priority: HIGH
### Labels: security, high, cors, cross-origin
EOF
)"
```

### 7. CSP Headers (PENDING)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🔥 HIGH: Missing Content Security Policy Headers" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ⚠️ PENDING

### Problem
Missing Content Security Policy headers, vulnerable to XSS and injection attacks.

### Progress
- ✅ CSP configuration created in security.ts
- ⚠️ Helmet middleware with CSP needs deployment

### Next Steps
- [ ] Apply helmet middleware with CSP to Express app
- [ ] Configure CSP directives for production environment
- [ ] Test CSP policy with browser DevTools
- [ ] Monitor CSP violation reports

### Priority: HIGH
### Labels: security, high, csp, headers
EOF
)"
```

### 8. Smart Contract (PENDING)
```bash
gh issue create --title "🔥 HIGH: Smart Contract Reentrancy Vulnerability" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Status: ⚠️ PENDING

### Problem
Smart contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in withdrawal functions.

### Progress
- ⚠️ Needs OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard implementation
- ⚠️ Should implement pull pattern instead of push pattern

### Next Steps
- [ ] Install OpenZeppelin contracts
- [ ] Add ReentrancyGuard to withdrawal functions
- [ ] Implement pull pattern for payments
- [ ] Add comprehensive smart contract tests
- [ ] Security audit before deployment

### Priority: HIGH
### Labels: security, high, smart-contract, reentrancy
